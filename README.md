Jenna – The origins of the public museum 

My reflections

The real meaning of 'public' ... 

Museum institutions should consider the participation of local communities when managing their collections; in this way, their projects have a higher chance of being culturally sensitive. 
When museums try to understand and adapt to the needs of local communities, a spirit of cooperation is developed among community members and stakeholders. Participatory mapping is another way for museums to promote culture inclusiveness. It gives the community a chance to express their perceptions and social constructions; and also to demonstrate what cultural/historic pieces they consider significant or not. 



Jacob – The political rationality of the museum
My reflections

Are museums supposed to only entertain? Inspire? Educate?
Or…
Do museums have the political duty to change the world?
For instance…
During Trump’s Inauguration, the Queen’s Museum closed its doors in protest. 
Unfortunately, many museums only serve the purpose to keep collections from the ‘culture capital’ that belongs to elites only. 
Alternatively, the museum can become a way for the middle class to appreciate art, since they cannot buy art.
Therefore, the museum might become a tool of inequality where everything is too white or too masculine.
Many museums are managed by intolerant scholars who promote a political monoculture of the humanities. 
Thus, activists argue how museums should focus on groups that are traditionally neglected. 
Museums should promote social justice; they are not supposed to be condescending with their visitors. 

Kieran  - The whole story, and then some: ‘digital storytelling’ in evolving museum practice
My reflections

Nowadays, museums are having to face a lot of competition with technology. Museums entertain… Technology entertains… Museums are educational… Technology is educational… Museums are engaging… Technology is engaging… 
Moreover, storytelling is one of the main mandates of museums. Their collections exhibit stories related to arts, music, literature, science and etcetera.  Nevertheless, technology can also be a powerful tool for storytelling; being even more interactive and adaptive to the individual. 
So… what could museums do to compete with technology?
IF YOU CANNOT BEAT THEM – JOIN THEM.
Museums are using technology, so the visitor is not only a passive observer, but also an active participant. 
In addition, Covid restrictions have caused people to explore virtual alternatives as well. 
For instance, the National Gallery of Canada is presenting online access to some of the Gallery’s Canadian, Indigenous and international collections. Plus, kids and adults can get creative with online activities.
